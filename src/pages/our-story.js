          We met in January 2018 during our Business Information Systems class at SF State. We ended up in the same project group for the semester, which meant weekly meetings, shared deadlines, and a lot of time together. After our final exam, we were chatting in the hallway before parting ways. A few minutes later, he called and asked if I wanted to go to the mall with him while he picked out an engagement gift for his brother and sister-in-law. That spontaneous moment led to everything that came after.

          Our first date took us to the Cliff House in San Francisco. We hiked all the way down to the beach, sat at the bottom of the cliffs, and watched the sun set over the ocean. It felt peaceful, natural, and strangely familiar, like we had known each other far longer than a semester.

          I realized he was the one during our first long weekend trip to Disneyland in August 2018. Traveling with him felt effortless. I was relaxed, happy, and completely myself. Every trip after that only deepened that feeling. And when he loved Koko instantly, and embraced all of his Coco-Loco sweetness, my heart pretty much melted.

          The proposal took place at Lake Como in Italy, right by the water. We took a private boat out early in the morning, and he proposed at Villa Balbiano, the iconic location where Padmé and Anakin’s wedding scene was filmed. I was overwhelmed with joy, gratitude, and love. It was perfect in every way.

          We met in Business Information Systems at SF State. The first day she walked into class, wearing her hat and glasses, I noticed her immediately. Her warm smile, kind eyes, and calm energy stood out. She sat next to me, which I jokingly tell her was her first move. My first move was asking her to hang out after finals.

          In my memory, our first date was at Stern Grove, where we walked and talked for what felt like hours. I remember feeling comfortable right away, as if I had known her much longer than just a few months.

          I knew she was the one during our first group project together. Her dedication, positivity, responsibility, and proactive nature showed me exactly who she was. Everything about her aligned with what I hoped for in a partner.

          When it came time for the proposal, I felt confident and excited. I knew she would love the moment, the setting, and the thought behind it. I was simply looking forward to the joy on her face.
